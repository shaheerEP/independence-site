            On **August 20, 1921**, when British police raided the Mampuram Mosque in Tirurangadi 
            and rumors spread that they had **desecrated the holy building**, Ali Musliyar knew 
            there was no turning back. Within hours, **2,000 Mappilas** surrounded the police 
            station, and the rebellion had begun.

          <blockquote>
            "If my sons are hanged for fighting the British, every mother in India will know
